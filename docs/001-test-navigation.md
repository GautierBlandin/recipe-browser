# Goal

Properly test navigation in the app.

## Steps

[ ] Create a test-container component. The test container should contain the providers needed for the app to run. Currently, this means the HashRouter and the Routes.
[ ] Refactor the tests (recipes-list.spec.tsx and recipe.spec.tsx) to use the test-container component.
[ ] Add tests that verify that: when clicking on the "View Recipes" button, the user is navigated to the recipes page.
[ ] Add tests that verify that: when clicking on a recipe from the recipes list, the user is navigated to the recipe page.
