## Problem we're trying to solve
I mostly cook only a handful of different dishes. Roasted chicken, pasta pesto, pasta carbonora, pasta salmon. Yet, I cooked dozens of different recipes in my life. The reason why I only cook a few different dishes is that I forget that the other recipes even exist. I can't hold them in my head. Also, I find it hard to plan to shop for these recipes.
I want an app that will solve this.

Why not just a spreadsheet with the recipe names ?
The look and feel of a spreadsheet is too basic. Also, a recipe is usually more than just a name. It has ingredients, steps, etc. I'd like to be able to save the ingredients for my recipe and the quantities. Also, ideally, I would like to be able to search my recipes by the ingredients they contain. That way, if I have a chicken at home, I could just look for all my recipes that contain chicken. Or if I want to make pasta, I can look for pasta recipes.
