Gautier is a home cook. He like to make simple food at home. Oftentimes, he has issues thinking about recipes he would like to make. To solve this issue, he wants a software solution that will enable him to quickly see recipes he knows and likes. He is not especially interested in finding new recipes for the interest, it's more about writing his own **cookbook**.

What's a self-made cookbook like in real life ? Usually, it's a binder that contains a lot of written recipes. In a cookbook, some of the typical information about a recipe include:
- Ingredients per portion, or for x portions
- A title for the recipe
- A longer description of what the recipe is
- A step by step guide that describes the steps to take to make the recipe
- The time that cooking the recipe is expected to take
- One or several pictures showing the recipes
